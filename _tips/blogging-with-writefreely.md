Hello Write Freely!

![](https://i.snap.as/cwQFF5Iu.jpeg)

Today, I'm not sure what I want to write. I figured you all should know I had Vietnamese Food for lunch.
```

If you're a Write.as Pro user, you can upload your images to [Snap.as](https://snap.as), and copy the  `Share on Write.as` markdown to include images in your post.

With this, ThiefMD will be ready to upload your images and you post through the `Export` window. Right-click on the post you want to publish, and click **Export**.

In the window, you can select `Write.as/user` as the Export Option. A Drop Down with your available collections will appear. Use this to choose where your post will appear.

As long as everything looks good, click on **Export**.

Once everything is done, links will appear to access the post along with a Token and ID corresponding to your post.

Happy Writing!
