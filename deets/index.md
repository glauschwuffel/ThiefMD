## Compilation & Multi-Format Export

<div class="responsive-left-short hoffman"><img src="/images/export_menu.png" alt="ThiefMD showing the export menu" /></div>

Writing a novel is no easy feat. Epic undertakings are easier to accomplish broken down into feasible tasks. The same thing goes for [great writing](/tips/novel-writing).

ThiefMD supports [exporting your work](/tips/novel-writing#sharing-your-work) from multiple folders and files.

Publish to PDF to send to friends over e-mail. [ePub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) if you want to preview your novel in your favorite e-Reader. docx or LaTeX if you're getting ready to turn in that report or dissertation.

However large the task and wherever you need to take it, ThiefMD has you covered[^okay-its-pandoc].

[^okay-its-pandoc]: Export powered by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). [Let us know](https://github.com/kmwallio/ThiefMD/issues) if we don't have you covered.

## Write-Good

<div class="responsive-right jonas"><img src="/images/write-good.png" alt="ThiefMD highlighting and suggesting writing improvements" /></div>

[Write-good](https://github.com/ThiefMD/libwritegood-vala) <span style="background: #0b8370; color: #FFF" title="Passive voice found, be active">was added</span> to ThiefMD to help check for passive voice.

Powered by logic stolen from [btford/write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good), ThiefMD can help improve your writing.

No more:
* Weasel words
* Passive voice
* Long and Complex Sentences
* Meaningless Wordy Words
* *and more*

Toggle it on, or toggle it off. They're <span style="background: #20528c; color: #FFF" title="Weak word found, be forceful">only</span> suggestions. <span style="background: #564a5e; color: #FFF" title="This sentence is very hard to read">Whether you've found your voice, looking for your voice, or writing in multiple voices, ThiefMD will help you get to where you want to be.</span>

<div class="clear"></div>

## Typewriter Scrolling

![ThiefMD's typewriter scrolling feature](/images/typewriter_scrolling.gif)

Stay centered and stay focused. Type writer scrolling keeps your active line fixed, both in the editor and the preview.

No longer look for where you're typing keep your eye muscles on what matters most.

## Focus Mode

<div class="responsive-left jonas"><img src="/images/focus_mode.png" alt="ThiefMD dimming all text except for the sentence being modified" /></div>

Eliminate distractions with focus mode. Paired with [typewriter scrolling](#typewriter-scrolling), ThiefMD can help keep you focused.

Don't get distracted by mark-up, other sentences, or multiple colors on the screen. Focus mode provides two colors: the background and your text.

You can focus by paragraph, sentence, or word. Paragraph Focus keeps things in context. Sentence focus prevents editing and revision while you write. Word focus keeps content flowing without looking back.

And yes, it works with [any theme you could throw at it](https://themes.thiefmd.com)[^if-not-file-a-bug].

[^if-not-file-a-bug]: If it doesn't please [let us know](https://github.com/kmwallio/ThiefMD/issues).

## YAML Frontmatter

<div class="responsive-right marcel"><img src="/images/jekyll-minimark.png" alt="ThiefMD rendering YAML frontmatter" /></div>

Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), or another [Static Site Generator](https://www.staticgen.com/)?

ThiefMD surfaces the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter) in the Folder View using minimark.

Live preview also renders any `title:` making your post look like art.

Our [export logic](/tips/novel-writing#novel-metadata) also understands [whatever metadata you may throw at it](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#epub-metadata).

<div class="clear"></div>

## KaTeX Support

<div class="responsive-left jonas"><img src="/images/katex_preview.png" alt="ThiefMD rendering a complex math formula" /></div>

We do not like math, but we'll support it.

Use [KaTeX](https://katex.org) to render Math Equations in Previews.

This requires libmarkdown 2.2.0 or greater. Using [flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.kmwallio.thiefmd) will let ThiefMD use the latest and greatest versions of its dependencies. Ubuntu 20.04 won't have Math Previews, but Fedora 32+ and Ubuntu 20.10 will.

For more power, [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) export will have you looking professional.

Export and finalize your work in [TeXstudio](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.texstudio.TeXstudio), [Setzer](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cvfosammmm.Setzer), or your favorite LaTeX editor.

The sky's the limit, and ThiefMD will help get you there.

## Syntax Highlighting

<div class="responsive-right hoffman"><img src="/images/syntax_preview.png" alt="ThiefMD syntax highlighting Vala code in various colors" /></div>

Writing a dev blog? Updating your [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx)?

[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) makes code shine. And since it's in ThiefMD, ThiefMD will make your code shine too!

I guess it's true what they say: the magic was inside ThiefMD all along.

Whether you're stealing something from the Public Domain or improving your own work, ThiefMD won't judge you. ThiefMD will assist you.

DocX, Odt, HTML, and other file acronyms can be dragged into the Library. Watch in wonder as they convert to Markdown under the covers.

Once you've made your changes, feel free to export them back. Or even [export them to something else](/tips/novel-writing#sharing-your-work).

[^ulysses-the-best]: [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) is our writing tool of choice on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) and our [theme generator](https://themes.thiefmd.com/howto) is a great way to make us match. ThiefMD is not affiliated with Ulysses.

In the Preferences Window (`Ctrl + ,`), you can now drag themes into the app.

Get immersed and match the whole UI or keep the colors for your words.
