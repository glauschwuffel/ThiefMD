# About

<div class="responsive-right hoffman"><img src="/images/preview.png" alt="ThiefMD's Live Preview Mode" /></div>

<img src="/images/thiefmd_64.png" style="float: left; height: 64px; width: 64px;" />ThiefMD is a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and [Fountain](https://fountain.io) editor and file manager inspired by [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app). It is [Open Source](https://github.com/kmwallio/ThiefMD) and based off of [other great open source software](#credit).

It is my primary way of attempting to learn [Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala) and filling in the gap of applications I miss from [macOS](https://apple.com).

ThiefMD aims to make large [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) projects manageable. I've always wanted to write a novel, and hopefully ThiefMD will help me get there.
