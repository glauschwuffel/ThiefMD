We've launch a [themes site](https://themes.thiefmd.com), [themes editor](https://themes.thiefmd.com/howto), and started work on [sharing our components](https://thiefmd.com/opensource).

<div class="responsive-center hoffman">
<img src="/images/theme_preferences.png" alt="ThiefMD with multiple themes applied" />
</div>

What's new?

* Better Dark vs Light theme detection. A theme package can contain 2 light or 2 dark themes. ThiefMD will use the luminance to determine if it's a light or dark theme
* Improved dynamic CSS, more elements colored hopefully preventing usability issues
* Improve handling of Ultheme files
* UI Incognito mode. Remove ThiefMD branding from main window
* Fixed typos in various menus
* [Ubuntu PPA](/download) now available
