* Themes can now style the entire application. Get immersed in your writing and lose track of the editor.
* Re-order your files and library items. Sort by file name, or drag and drop. It's up to you.
* Export from the Library. Right-click on an Item, to view the combined document, then export. You want to write the next great novel? We want to help you get there.

* Export settings in the Preferences. It's just a `Ctrl + ,` away.
* Improved theme parsing. There's still a few quirks, but most themes now look better.
