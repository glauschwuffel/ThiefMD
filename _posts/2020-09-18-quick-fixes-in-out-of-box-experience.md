Whoops. Fixing some bugs found in testing for starting from an empty library.

<!-- more -->

* Fix attempting to export project with no item selected
* If a folder is added to the library and the library is empty, pick the item so New Sheet button works
* arm64 flathub build should hopefully find a usable version of pandoc
* Show error message if file given for export is wrong
