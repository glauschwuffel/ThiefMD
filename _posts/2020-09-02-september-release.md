This release focuses on blogging. We added some new UI features and better Library management tools.

Now that we're releasing binary packages, an about dialog has been added linking to projects used and their licenses.

<!-- more -->

 Update the post timestamp with ease.
* **Drag and Drop Files**

 Move a markdown file into another directory in the library. You could switch a `_draft` to a `_post`.
