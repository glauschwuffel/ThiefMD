# ThiefMD, the Markdown Editor worth stealing

Based on Open Source Technologies, ThiefMD is a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) & [Fountain](https://fountain.io) editor and file manager inspired by [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app). ThiefMD is based on open source code from [Quilter](https://github.com/lainsce/quilter) and [other projects](/about#credit).

Static Site Generators? Novel Writing? Book reports? Screen plays? ThiefMD loves handling all your markdown files and compiling them to whatever format you need. [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) runs under the hood, so if you can dream it, ThiefMD can build it.

Manage your <span class="pun">**\*\*mark\*\***</span> without any <span class="ny">_\_down\__</span>sides. Your library is your file system. Sync using any service you choose[^no-file-sync]. Even use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to have a file history[^no-git].

[^no-file-sync]: ThiefMD has no sync support built in.
[^no-git]: ThiefMD has no built in Git support.

# Live Preview

See what your work looks like in real time. Is that your battery draining? Yes, and the Markdown it's powering never looked so good.

A separate window allows for focusing on your writing or reading. From [blogging](/tips/jekyll) to [novel writing](/tips/novel-writing), ThiefMD helps your words look good ðŸ˜Ž

Once you like what you see, [export with ease](/tips/novel-writing#sharing-your-work) to ePub, DocX, PDF, and more.

Spell checking and weasel word detection are also built in.
